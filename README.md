# HCDE-310

This is Tianyi Ren’s final project for HCDE 310. It’s a webpage using recipe analysis API. It’s built in python, using bootstrap, Jinja and Flask.

The workable online version is here:

In my final version of my project, I included meal plan making, random meal plan generator and recipe search. 
Users can request a meal plan for a day (with three dishes, one breakfast) or a plan for a week(3 X 7 dishes). 
Users can use random recipe generator to get a random recipe. 
Users can search for a recipe based on a dish name. 

I also added a better HTML and CSS page based on bootstrap. I added card, button and icons from bootstrap component library.
